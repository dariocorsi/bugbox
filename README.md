# Bugbox

This project is currently just an outlet to do some casual illustration with a consistent theme.

## Setup

The site is pretty basic Jekyll site. 

## Insects

Each insect is a post inside '_posts/' with the following front matter:

### layout

## title 

The post title

### name

The insect name. Probably the same as title. Will likely merge this two attributes in the future.

### latin

The latin name for the insect.

### categories

Currently unused.

### order

The order that the insect belongs to.

### image

The URL to the SVG for the insect. 

Example: 'assets/svg/insect-name.svg'

### wiki  

The URL to a Wikipedia entry for the insect.

## Illustration

### Format

Illustration is currently saved to scale at 144 dpi. For example, a two-inch insect would be saved out at 288px.

### Style Guidelines

- Illustrations should be as geometric as possible, while maintaining distinguishing marks and segment shapes. 
- The perspective should be top down, with the head at the top and abdomen at the bottom
- Avoid gradients
