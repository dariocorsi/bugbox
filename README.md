#Bugbox

This project is currently just an outlet to do some casual illustration with a consistent theme.

##Setup

The site is pretty basic Jekyll site. 

##Insects

Each insect is a post inside '_posts/' with the following front matter:

- layout
- title 
- name
- latin
- date
- categories
- family
- image
- wiki  


##Illustration

###Format
Illustration is currently saved to scale at 144 dpi. For example, a two-inch insect would be saved out at 288px.

###Guidelines
Illustrations should be as geometric as possible, while maintaining distinguishing marks and segment shapes.
