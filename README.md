# Bugbox

This project is an outlet to do some casual illustration with a consistent theme.

## Setup

The site is pretty basic Jekyll install. 

## Insects

Each insect is a post inside '_posts/' with the following front matter:

### layout

Defaults to 'post'.

### title 

The post title.

### name

The insect name. Probably the same as title. Will likely merge this two attributes in the future.

### latin

The latin name for the insect.

### categories

Currently unused.

### order

The order that the insect belongs to.

### image

The URL to the SVG for the insect. 

Example: 'assets/svg/insect-name.svg'

### wiki  

The URL to a Wikipedia entry for the insect.

## Illustration

### Format

All illustration should be saved as an SVG.

### Scale

Illustration is currently saved to scale at 144 dpi. 

For example, a two-inch insect would be saved out at 288px.

### Style Guidelines

- Keep illustration as geometric as possible, while maintaining distinguishing marks and segment shapes. 
- The perspective should be top down, with the head at the top and abdomen at the bottom.
- Avoid gradients.
- When a size range is given, use the larger size.
